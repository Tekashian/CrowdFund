 * @title Crowdfund Contract (Refactored v5.5.1 - Comprehensive NatSpec, Fair Failed Refunds, Advanced Commissions)
 * @author [Twoje ImiÄ™/Nazwa Firmy/Pseudonim Developera]
 * @notice This contract facilitates ERC20-based crowdfunding campaigns, offering distinct commission structures
 * for donations, successful campaign withdrawals, and (optionally) donor-initiated refunds.
 * It prioritizes donor security by waiving refund commissions for campaigns that do not meet their funding goals.
 * @dev Inherits ReentrancyGuard for security against reentrancy attacks, Ownable for access control,
 * and Pausable for emergency stop functionality (all from OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.x).
 * The contract is designed for gas efficiency using custom errors and optimized state management.
 * All monetary values related to campaigns (targets, donations, etc.) are handled in terms of the
 * specific ERC20 token chosen for that campaign.
